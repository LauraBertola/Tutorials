**Population Genetics Analyses**

This section is specifically about downstream analyses, once you have a files with SNPs or genotype likelihoods. 

So far, a walk-through for the following topics are available:
* [PCA tigers - genotype calls (WGS high depth)](PCA_tigers_genotype_calls_(WGS_high_depth).md)
* [PCA lions - genotype likelihoods (WGS low depth)](PCA_tigers_genotype_likelihoods_(WGS_low_depth).md)
