Here I will place various components which I hope will be useful for people interested in Conservation Genomics. The aim is to include both raw data processing, including quality control, mapping, variant calling etc., and downstream population genetic inferences, such as population structure, phylogenetics, genetic diversity, gene flow, introgression, etc. 

Most of the work will be done using command line. If you're not familiar with this, there are good (free!) introductory courses on [Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-bash-scripting]) and [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). You can also find a good overview of the most common commands [here](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php). There are tons of good resources out there, and ChatGPT can be helpful, especially when it comes to fixing the syntax.

To access Unix/Linux shell environment, you can use the native terminal when you're a Mac/Linux user. If you're on Windows, please install [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/).

For the downstream population genetics, we'll mostly be using R. Also for R, there are good (free!) introductory courses on [Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/free-introduction-to-r) and [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r). Also for R, there are many good resources out there, and also here, ChatGPT can be really helpful.
