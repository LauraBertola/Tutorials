# WGS (high depth)

This part will deal with processing of whole genome sequencing data (WGS) of medium-to-high sequencing depth. Here, I'm referring to >6X genome-wide average sequencing depth, which allows for reliably calling heterozygous sites following this pipeline.

This section will use data from Bengal tigers from [Khan et al. (2021)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8813985/). Note that the data are downsampled, so these steps can be run quickly, for educational purposes only.

You can find the steps for quality control, trimming and mapping [here](FastQC_Trimming_Mapping.md)
