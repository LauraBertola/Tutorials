# RADseq

This part will deal with processing of a Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), which is a form of reduced representation sequencing. This allows for cost-effective analyses of a larger number of samples, making this a useful strategy when funding is limited (and it always is :slightly_frowning_face:).

This section relies heavily on resources created for [RADcamp](https://radcamp.github.io/), so a big thank you to Dr. Isaac Overcast and all RADcamp contributors over the years! We will use data from cheetahs from [Prost et al. (2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.16577). Note that the data are downsampled, so these steps can be run quickly, for educational purposes only.

You can find more information about the raw data and steps for quality control [here](Data_FastQC.md).
The steps for using the actual Ipyrad pipeline are [here](Ipyrad.md).
Note that there are exercises with additional information [here](Exercises.md).
